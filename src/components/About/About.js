          <p style={font}>As an immigrant from Brazil, my journey has been dedicated to empowering individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. In my past careers, I've delved into mental health care and recruitment. </p>
          <p style={font}>However, it was a transformative moment in a 'Try Coding' class at the Turing School of Software & Design that revealed my true passion â€” Software Engineering. The undeniable excitement and fulfillment from that class lingered with me. </p>
          <p style={font}>I am now offering freelance web services, including website development and management. I am always open to new opportunities, networking, and more -- so please feel free to connect with me!</p>
